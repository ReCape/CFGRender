# CFGRender
This tool will use THREE.js to render an OptiFine config file (plus texture) in the browser. It could theoretically work with JEM files too, but no promises.
## What it does
It will load the model.cfg and texture.png from the same folder and generate a THREE.js scene with orbit controls. Plans are to make the URLs that it loads from configurable, as well as how it creates the scene.
## Why?
The ReCape team is planning on using this for the client as a model viewer.
